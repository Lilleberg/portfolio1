            <li>Added used games and new games pages.</li>
            <li>Cleaned up the HTML a little bit (though more could be

            <li>Set a min height on the main section to always fill the
              page.</li>
            <li>Restructured the shopping cart code. It wasn't working
              correctly at all.</li>
            <li>Added a dot showing amount of products in cart on the cart
              icon.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="how-changes">
          <h3>How the Changes Were Made</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>To set a minimum height on the pages, I just the calc()
              function in CSS. I set the main section to be 100vh minus ca.
              the pixel height of header and footer.</li>
            <li>
              <p>The shopping cart code now works across pages. This
                wouldn't be possible without help from fellow students. In
                cart.js there is an if/else to check if localStorage is
                empty
                or not. If it's empty a new array is created for the
                products. The cart has a function that loops through what
                is in localStorage, and then creates HTML, as well as keep
                track of the price.</p>
              <p>Since add to cart buttons are created in HTML, the onclick
                function is now inside the API call function. This is to
                have access to the buttons.
                The buttons have a data attribute which holds the product's
                ID. When the button is clicked a find() function is used to
                find the product based on the ID, from the API call. The
                products is then added to the array that belongs to
                localStorage.</p>
              <p>To get the shopping cart to update immediately when a
                products is added, I have called the function from the cart
                that creates HTML inside the button click functions. But
                since that cart function creates HTML, I had to make a call
                to the function before button is clicked (have it updated
                if one goes to another page), then inside the button click
                function I reset the HTML and price, and then made a new
                call to create the HTML based on what's in localStorage.
                This way I didn't get any HTML duplicates, and the cart is
                updated across pages.</p>
              <p>I added the same empty innerHTML/function call into the
                global.js file to keep it
                updated on pages that don't have any products on them.</p>
            </li>
            <li>For the amount of products in cart visibility on the cart
              icon, I just placed a div around the cart icon and a span.
              Position relative on the div, and position absolute on the
              span. Then I used JavaScript and checked the length of what
              was inside the cart (key) in localStorage, and added that as
              the span's innerHTML.</li>
          </ul>

        <section class="why-changes">
          <h3>Why I Made the Changes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I added the pages for used games and new games so the site
              is more complete.</li>
            <li>The HTML isn't as semantic as it could be here and there
              because this was the first project. I changed it some places,
              where I have been working and saw things. If I had time, I'd
              rather write it all over again.</li>
            <li>Since this was the first project, my CSS is a bit chaotic,
              I would need a lot more time to clean it up properly.</li>
            <li>I didn't really fully understand meta descriptions at
              first, so that's why I fixed these, they are now better
              descriptions. As well as changed the
              meta description with JavaScript on the product specific
              pages to fit the product.</li>
            <li>A site for shopping needs a functioning shopping cart. And
              I really wanted to make it work. It was a fun way to learn
              how localStorage works. Again I need to mention that this
              would not have been working if I didn't have help with how to
              structure my code. A cart also usually has an indicator of
              how many items it's holding, so I had to add that.</li>
            <li>Note: There are still things to be fixed for it to be a
              very good site, but the cart took much of my time with all
              the trial and error (and also didn't have time to figure out
              how to solve how to have a quantity counter if the same
              product is added more than once).</li>

            <li>Changed the cross-over between headings and navigation on

            <li>Edited the navigation on desktop, and changed the
              hamburger
              menu from a checkbox to a button. The navigation will also
              close if you click outside it on the main section.</li>

        <section class="how-changes">
          <h3>How the Changes Were Made</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The heading/navigation cross-over were separated. Now the
              section navigation instead sticks to the top of the screen
              when
              scrolling.</li>
            <li>The smooth scroll behavior was set on the html to work on
              the
              navigation mentioned above.</li>
            <li>The width of the content was lessened, as it was a bit
              wide
              before.</li>
            <li>The desktop navigation had an underline when active
              before,
              and a white background. Now it's more in style with the
              active
              page with colour and placement.</li>
            <li>The previously used checkbox hack for the hamburger menu
              is
              now a button that uses JavaScript to work by an onclick
              function checking if it's displayed as block or none.</li>
            <li>Form validation was added with JavaScript, checking that
              emails have the right format, and that the input fields
              have
              a
              minimum length.</li>
          </ul>

        <section class="why-changes">
          <h3>Why I Made the Changes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Feedback on the project said the pages without gradient
              were
              easier to read. I agree.</li>
            <li>Feedback said the cross-over between heading and
              navigation
              wasn't very intuitive, so that was changed.</li>
            <li>The smooth scroll behavior was a tip I got from the
              feedback
              on the project, and it does indeed make it better.</li>
            <li>The width of the content felt a bit too wide on desktops,
              which is why that was changed.</li>
            <li>I changed the way the active links on the pages look
              because
              it was a bit boring. I feel like it now fits better with
              the
              target audience and the theme.</li>
            <li>The form was changed to look a bit better. Form
              validation
              is
              also good to have on forms.</li>
            <li>The HTML had some semantic problems: there were sections
              without headings; the fake links were paragraphs instead of
              links (feedback on project); the footer headings didn't use
              any
              heading tag, so I changed all that. On one page I had two
              H1's
              as well, now there's only one.</li>

              call on the posts page with the "view more" button. And then

        </section>
        <section class="how-changes">
          <h3>How the Changes Were Made</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Since the API has a set order on the posts (when they're
              published), it was possible to read the first 10 posts on the
              posts page, and then start a new for loop where the counter
              starts at 10.</li>
            <li>
              <p>The comment section was not an easy task, and has resulted
                in hours of googling, trying and failing. I was trying to
                do
                what some examples were doing to save the form data with
                fetch() and .then/.catch, but only
                got errors. After looking some more on the comment API, I
                then realised I had the wrong property for ID when saving
                the data as an object. But still got errors. Some error
                were about the comments not having a post, and others about
                authentication.</p>
              <p>I then ended up googling "fetch body" because I was trying
                to understand how another code online worked, which somehow
                showed me a different code snippet which seemed to sort of
                do the same as I had tried. This code used async, and was a
                bit different than the form submission code snippets I had
                already seen, but I tried and it worked. No errors, and
                comments showed up in wordpress.</p>
              <p>The values from the inputs as well as post ID is stored as
                an object, and then the data is stringified and added to
                the body property. All this was new to me, so I am still
                learning how posting data works.</p>
              <p>To add the comments into the site was easy, as I just did
                a normal API call (the way we have learned) to the comments
                link, and created HTML with the properties I wanted.</p>
              <p>Note: One change I have not figured out is how to update
                the comment section on submit. So to view it the page has
                to be refreshed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>To store the contact form data in WordPress, I followed a
                tutorial on CSS tricks. It's heading was exactly what I was
                looking for. The first step was adding the Contact Form 7
                plugin, and connect my contact form to this one.</p>
              <p>It took me some googling to realise that Contact Form 7
                doesn't store data, but it has a plugin friend called
                Flamingo which does. So I didn't really know if my function
                to post the data worked until I had Flamingo up and
                running.</p>
              <p>So eventually I ended up with a bit of the code from the
                CSS trick page, the most necessary to actually post, and I
                added the code I already have with a success message. To
                get the data from the form, I first create a form element,
                which targets the action and method from the form, then
                create new FormData which is the body. So this makes sense,
                the data is stored and the fetch posts the data.</p>
              <p>I still didn't think it worked, so I went to the Flamingo
                plugin on my WordPress to see if I had missed any settings
                or anything, but to my surprise there suddenly was
                something there. Turns out it worked after all. And now the
                contact form data is stored in my WordPress.</p>

          <h3>Why I Made the Changes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I changed the way I add the HTML to the posts page, because
              I didn't have a good solution before (got a tip on how to do
              this one). So with the new way I could have the posts shown
              on the desktop version as I had intended.</li>
            <li>My CSS (and HTML as well) is not perfect. So I try
              to clean it up, keep the CSS DRY and neat, and HTML semantic,
              if I come across things while working on the page. There is
              more that can be cleaned up if there was more time.</li>
            <li>A blog usually has a comment section, so I felt this was
              the most necessary feature to add. I didn't think I was able
              to make it work at all first, but the hours paid off
              eventually.</li>
            <li>Usually a contact form is sent somewhere so someone can
              reply, and for this project the level 2 process was (for me)
              a bit of a challenge I wanted to try to make work. So it's a
              good functionality to have on a site.</li>
