          <h3>Changes made</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Removed the gradient in the background.</li>
            <li>Changed the cross-over between headings and navigation on
              Explore.html.</li>
            <li>Added smooth scroll behavior.</li>
            <li>Edited the width of the content on all pages.</li>
            <li>Added alt text on the logo, as well as changed the logo a
              little bit.</li>
            <li>Edited the navigation on desktop, and changed the
              hamburger
              menu from a checkbox to a button. The navigation will also
              close if tou click outside it on the main section.</li>
            <li>Removed non-working search field.</li>
            <li>Changed the contact form a little bit, and added form
              validation it.</li>
            <li>Cleaned up the HTML a bit.</li>

          <h3>How the Changes Were Made</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The heading/navigation cross-over were separated. Now the
              section navigation instead sticks to the top of the screen
              when
              scrolling.</li>
            <li>The smooth scroll behavior was set on the html to work on
              the
              navigation mentioned above.</li>
            <li>The width of the content was lessened, as it was a bit
              wide
              before.</li>
            <li>The desktop navigation had an underline when active
              before,
              and a white background. Now it's more in style with the
              active
              page with colour and placement.</li>
            <li>The previously used checkbox hack for the hamburger menu
              is
              now a button that uses JavaScript to work by an onclick
              function checking if it's displayed as block or none.</li>
            <li>Form validation was added with JavaScript, checking that
              emails have the right format, and that the input fields
              have
              a
              minimum length.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="why-changes">
          <h3>Why I Made the Changes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Feedback on the project said the pages without gradient
              were
              easier to read. I agree.</li>
            <li>Feedback said the cross-over between heading and
              navigation
              wasn't very intuitive, so that was changed.</li>
            <li>The smooth scroll behavior was a tip I got from the
              feedback
              on the project, and it does indeed make it better.</li>
            <li>The width of the content felt a bit too wide on desktops,
              which is why that was changed.</li>
            <li>I changed the way the active links on the pages look
              because
              it was a bit boring. I feel like it now fits better with
              the
              target audience and the theme.</li>
            <li>The form was changed to look a bit better. Form
              validation
              is
              also good to have on forms.</li>
            <li>The HTML had some semantic problems: there were sections
              without headings; the fake links were paragraphs instead of
              links (feedback on project); the footer headings didn't use
              any
              heading tag, so I changed all that. On one page I had two
              H1's
              as well, now there's only one.</li>
